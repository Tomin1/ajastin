This is a simple timer for AtTiny85 (should work on 45 as well). Just some
timer interrupts and charlieplexing. Nothing fancy here. Schematic is made
using Kicad.

The code and schematic is under MIT License and everything in this project is
quite simple. So, if you find something useful, you may use it in your project
without worrying. Just don't plain copy this and say it's yours. Note that the
Makefile has some parts from links that are mentioned in its beginning.

Feel free to contact me, if you have questions.
