 * This is a small timer program for AtTiny85
 *
 * This code is made for AtTiny85, but should work with AtTiny[24]5 too.
 * Use 1 MHz clock with this code. It is quite safe to disable brown-out
 * detection as this code doesn't write any memory. The code runs
 * ISR(TIMER0_COMPA_vect) (FREQUENCY * NUMBER_OF_LEDS) times a second.
 * Time is adjusted by TIME in seconds.
 *
 * The code uses charlieplexing to drive 5 leds. Therefore every led
 * will be lit FREQUENCY times per second and their duty cycle is
 * 1/NUMBER_OF_LEDS.
