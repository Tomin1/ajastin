 * This is a small timer program for AtTiny85
 *
 * This code is made for AtTiny85, but should work with AtTiny[24]5 too.
 * Use 1 MHz clock with this code. It is quite safe to disable brown-out
 * detection as this code doesn't write any memory. The code runs
 * ISR(TIMER0_COMPA_vect) (FREQUENCY * NUMBER_OF_LEDS) times a second.
 * Time is adjusted by TIME in seconds.
 *
 * The code uses charlieplexing to drive 5 leds. Therefore every led
 * will be lit FREQUENCY times per second and their duty cycle is
 * 1/NUMBER_OF_LEDS.
 *
 * Piezo is driven by TIMER0_COMPA vector so it runs approximately at
 * the frequency of (FREQUENCY * NUMBER_OF_LEDS).
 *
 * Usage:
 * Power on. Set time by pressing the button until the time you want is
 * shown. Wait for about BUTTON_WAIT_TIME seconds. Now the LED_ON led
 * lights and the timer starts counting. When it finished the piezo
 * speaker starts buzzing. You can stop it and power down the counter by
 * pressing the button. To restart the timer press reset button.  The
 * button doesn't do anything while counting and the reset button resets
 * the timer back to setting the timer.
